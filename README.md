# Fruit Image Classification using CNN
In this notebook, we classify fruit images from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits"> <b>Fruit 360 dataset</b> </a> using Convolution Neural Network Implemented by a Keras Model

<b>DESCRIPTION OF THE DATASET</b>
<br>
The dataset has a total number of 90483 images of fruits and vegetables clustered into 131 classes.
<br>
The dataset is split into:
<li>Training set size: 67692 images (one fruit or vegetable per image).</li>
<li>Test set size: 22688 images (one fruit or vegetable per image).</li>

<br>
For modelling, I used a sample of 20 different classes of fruits and vegetables.
